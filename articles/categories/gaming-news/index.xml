      <description>GOG recently advertised the newly released Postal 2: Paradise Lost for their online distribution store, prompting some users to fire backlash back at GOG. The tweet in question shows a gravestone noting the date of the now infamous day that multiple gaming press outlets simultaneously published &amp;ldquo;Gamers Are Dead&amp;rdquo; articles, which helped give rise to the GamerGate movement which seeked to restore ethical journalistic policies for said outlets.
After various Twitter users fired backlash towards GOG, GOG pulled the tweet in question and issued the below apology, sparking even more backlash from GamerGate supporters over GOGs apparent lack of understanding about the movement, and the mischaracterisation of the movement in general:</description>

      <description>Australian senator David Leyonhjelm has introduced the Freedom of Speech Legislation Amendment proposal, which would amend the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 to:
 Remove the ban on publications, films and computer games that offend against standards of morality, decency and propriety.
 And also amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to:
 Remove bans on broadcasting, datacasting and online content, with a specific focus on bans affecting services provided behind paywalls; narrow the guidance provided by government to broadcasting industries and datacasting licensees in the development of codes of practice; remove certain restrictions on subscription television broadcasters and online content services relating to programs or content that has been or would be classified as X 18+, ‘category 1 restricted’ or ‘category 2 restricted’; and remove a ban on broadcasting electoral advertising relating to a federal, state, territory or local election on election day or on the preceding Thursday or Friday.</description>

      <description>The Higher Regional Court of Munich has ruled that pre-orders with &amp;ldquo;vague&amp;rdquo; release dates are illegal.
The issue was brought to the regional court by a German rights advocacy group, who sued Mediamarkt for illegal information in the online ordering of a smartphone.
According to the judgement, indeterminate statements regarding the delivery of online goods and orders violates the legal duty of information of the seller. The customer is entitled to a specific delivery date before clicking on the order button, and information such as &amp;ldquo;soon to be available&amp;rdquo; are in violation of the consumers rights.</description>

      <description>We Happy Few, first revealed at PAX East 2015, has been denied classification in Australia. According to the Department of Communications and the Arts, We Happy Few was denied classification because:
 The computer game is classified RC in accordance with the National Classification Code, Computer Games Table, 1. (a) as computer games that &amp;ldquo;depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified.</description>
