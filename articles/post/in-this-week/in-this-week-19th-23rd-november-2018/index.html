<h3 id="sony-apologises-to-banned-user-over-offensive-name">Sony Apologises To Banned User Over Offensive Name</h3>

<p>Sony has apologised to a Playstation 4 user after banning him from the Playstation network.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“My online ID is/was: Kike_0615. Kike is short for my real name, Enrique, and in Mexico a lot of people call guys with that name “Kike”. It is also pronounced “KEE-KAY”. After I did some research it’s apparently used as an offensive way of calling Jewish people. Sort of like the N word for my African Americans. Btw I’m really sorry if I offend anyone by posting my nickname, I swear to god that’s my nickname since I was little, I even have soccer and high school track/XC shirts/sweaters with my nickname.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Below is the email he received upon being banned:</p>

<p><img class="image" style="max-width: 600px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/AUCRuAO.png"></p>

<p>After his complaint going viral, a sony representative got in touch to sort things straight:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Hi Enrique, first off I’d like to apologize for everything. We caught wind and saw what you posted and said online. And I can assure you we got to work on it as soon as possible. We setup a quick meeting at the office and trust me, we had an interesting conversation, especially as it’s thanksgiving(he chuckles). But I’m glad to inform you your account is fully re-activated. I’d like to apologize in behalf of all of us. You can keep your current Online ID as we realized we made a mistake…”</em></p>

<h3 id="uk-gambling-commission-young-people-and-gambling-2018-survey-loot-boxes">UK Gambling Commission: Young People and Gambling 2018 Survey &amp; Loot Boxes</h3>

<p>The UK Gambling Commission has refuted claims that loot boxes are linked to real world gambling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve not in anyway, in the survey, referred to it as exposure to gambling,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The reason we&rsquo;ve asked that question is that it&rsquo;s a very popular subject matter and we want to try and make sure that we have as much information and data around it as possible.&rdquo;</em></p>
